##NYCDSA Project 1 Blurb: Federal Student Loan Data

In this project I explore data associated with government student loans which can be found [here)](http://www.ifap.ed.gov/ifap/byAwardYear.jsp?type=perkinscdrguide&set=archive&display=single).
I also made use of [census data](http://www.census.gov/popest/data/state/totals/2014/index.html) in the latter part of my exploration.  

NB. I'll add the html after fixing a strange error that came out of the blue.
